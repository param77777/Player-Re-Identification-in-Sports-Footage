# Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage

This project performs player detection and re-identification in a football match video using the YOLO object detection model and the Deep SORT tracking algorithm. It processes a short video clip and outputs a new video where each player is tracked and consistently labeled throughout the footage.

## üß† Overview

The project takes a video of a football match (`football.mp4`) and applies the following pipeline:

1. **YOLOv8** is used to detect all objects in each frame.
2. Only football players are retained (excluding class ID 0, which is often "person").
3. **Deep SORT** assigns consistent IDs to players across frames using both motion and appearance features.
4. The final output video (`out.mp4`) shows each detected player in a unique color with a label (e.g., `Player 3`).
